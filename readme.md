# Bayesian Neural Networks with alpha-divergence

Implementations for the following Bayesian Neural Network setups introduced in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06544 and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07127. The objective of the repository is to compare two approaches and showcase differences on a simple one dimensional data bi-model prediction problem given in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07127. 

The implementation uses alpha-divergence minimization to estimate the predictive distribution of a stochastic function.
